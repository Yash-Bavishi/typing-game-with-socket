# Typing Game with Socket

# Introduction:

Hello my name is Yash Bavishi ðŸ‘‹. I made this game for learning about [socket.io](http://socket.io) and how to integrate it with ReactJS. 

 

# Technologies used

1. [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org) A front framework
2. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) Js a middleware used on nodejs to making routing easy
3. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) a javascript runtime engine
4. [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) A library which integrate with nodejs and express easily.

# Development PlanðŸ”§

## Phase 1.

- [x]  Setup React with react, routes and states etc (`frontend`)

## Phase 2.

- [x]  Setup backend with routes and data (`backend` )

## Phase 3

- [x]  Integerate Socket with frontend and backend (`backend` )

## Phase 4

- [ ]  Take user input in real time and validate answer and send who sent first (`backend`)

# Current problems 

- [ ] Multiple socket connection established from client side this behaviour leads to false requests which leads to denial of service for user
